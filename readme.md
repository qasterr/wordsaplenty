# Words aplenty
### A Python CLI tool for checking words in a dictionary

## Usage
First, clone the repository by typing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qasterr/wordsaplenty.git
```
Then use the following command:
```bash
py dictionary.py <word> [-t word_type] [-l language] [-d dictionary]
```
`word_type` defaults to `noun`, `language` to `en_GB` and `dictionary` to `dictionary_api` as it's the only one that has been implemented yet.
